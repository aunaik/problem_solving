# Generate Hotel Menu

Say we have a set of cusines, each of which can be represented by a letter of the alphabet, and a set of dishes with each cusine, each of which can be repersented by a number. Each cusine has a different number if possible dishes available. A menu consists of a set ofdishes chosen from the different cusines. A menu can be represented by a list of dishes such as 'A3 B11 C4'. Assume that each menu contains eactly one dish from each cuisine and all cusines are included.

Write a program that takes the numer of cusines and the number of dishes available within each cusine as input and list all possible menus as output.
